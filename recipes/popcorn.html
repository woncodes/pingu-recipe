    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>While their parents are out, Pingu and Pinga decide to cook some popcorn. 
      <br>Pingu puts a pan on the warm stove and Pinga brings him a cob of corn.
      <br>Pingu puts the corn into the pan and they start jumping up and down until he puts the lid on.
      <br>They soon have a full pan of popcorn which they both gobble up straight away.
      <br>Pinga wants to make more popcorn so she puts wood into the boiler.
      <br>Pingu loads all the corn he can, and soon popcorn starts exploding out of the boiler, all over the floor...
